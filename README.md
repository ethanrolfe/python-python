A python editor... in python?

Python coded using Python, Python code parsed for syntax highlighting by Python, Python extending the capabilities of Python.
You get the idea.

My goal—after getting what is a text editor to run code—is to implement syntax highlighting, packages; make it an "Atom Python Speciale"

Cobbled together from my code, the code of others, and possibly your code; this isn't going to be amazing, but it dun gon teech me.
